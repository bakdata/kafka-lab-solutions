# kafka-lab

Welcome to the Kafka Lab! In this lab, we will walk you through building a data pipeline using Kafka and Kafka
Streams.
The overall architecture is shown in the picture below. This pipeline will read a runner's data and cleans/converts
the data and then calculate the average heart rate of the runners in a time window.

Go to each component for more information and implement the code so the test(s) pass! Good luck!
